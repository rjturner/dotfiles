dotfiles
========

A full reboot of my original dotfiles project, based on what I learned there.
Mainly I learned that it is possible but stupid to make my home directory a git
repository. This repository sits in a subdirectory with symlink install.

install
-------

1. Set up SSH keyless login
2. git clone git@github.com:rjturner/dotfiles.git
